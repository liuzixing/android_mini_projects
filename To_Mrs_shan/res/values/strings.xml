    <string name="thankyou">Mrs.Shan, thank you for giving this cup as my birthday gift.
        although I&#8242;ve left China, I take this cup with me. I want you to know I love you,
        so my first android app will be for you. Here I wrote a poem for you:
        you a happy new year and a good fortune in the coming year when we will share our happiness, think of our good friends, and our dreams come true!
        wish to meet my angle again lovely girl in my dream!
        oh, how much i miss you! if the passionate refreshing breeze knows my heart, it can tell you that i miss you and care you for my life&#8242;s time. 
        if graceful white cloud knows my heart, it can tell you i love you and would be together with you forever.
        It is graceful grief and sweet sadness to think of you, but in my heart, there is a kind of soft warmth that can&#8242;t be expressed with any choice of words.</string>
